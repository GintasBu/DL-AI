RNN projects implementations: Project 1: predict stock price time series in future Project 2: generate text based on training text

CNN application to recognize dog breed from an image. Used transfer learning from ResNet trained coefficients. Accuracy on test set ~85%. Prior to that buit and trained few CNN model from scratch to recognice dog breeds, and distinguish dogs from humans when image was partially covered. Images of dogs and people used to test the recognizer.
